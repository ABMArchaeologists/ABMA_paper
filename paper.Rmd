# Introduction

ABM application increased in Archaeology

No formal training

EU project

# Method

During the project we have developed tutorials. The tutorials were first designed using storyboards which were later converted into tutorials using NetLOGO Web (<https://www.netlogoweb.org/launch>) and Javascript (). The tutorials were developed together and we worked together using GitHub (<https://github.com/lljvdk/EU-ABMA/>). During the project initial testing was done with all authors and issues in GitHub were used to tackle bugs.

The tutorial were tested during various online and in-person conferences. In addition, we also had students working with the tutorials at Saxion Universty of applied sciences and Leiden University. We used the feedback of the participants to improve the tutorials. The feedback was obtained structurally using two surveys using Qualtrics. The participants of the events were asked to answer questions of a survey before participating. We used the answers to understand what the background of the participants was and to get an estimate of their level of knowledge in relation to ABM (see appendix ... for the questions). After the participants worked with the tutorials during the event they were asked to answer a second survey. Questions of this survey were aimed at the measuring the effectiveness of the tutorials and getting feedback on the workshop and tutorials (see appendix ... for the questions). For some events participants had to register beforehand and we were able to send the pre-workshop survey by email. At other events no registration was possible or necessary and the pre-workshop survey was given at the start of the event. The post-workshop survey was distributed using QR-codes or links at the end of the workshop during the event. After each event we have improved the tutorials based on the received feedback.

: Conferences, events and situations were the workshops given and the tutorials were tested.

The surveys were analysed using R [@rcoreteam2023]. The following packages were used for analyses: ggplot2 [@wickham2016], dplyr [@wickham2023a], tidyr [@wickham2023], forcats[@wickham2023b] , lubridate [@grolemund2011] and stringr [@wickham2023c]. The date and the code is available at <https://github.com/RonaldVisser/ABM_tutorials> and (... insert Zenodo reference...)

# Results

## Tutorials

## Before tutorial

The participants of the workshop came from many different countries all over the world.

```{r}
#pre_surveys <- readRDS("data/pre_workshop_surveys.rds")
#ggplot(pre_surveys, aes(x = `What.is.you.nationality....Nationality...Text`)) +
#  geom_bar() +  coord_flip() + xlab("Nationality")

```

```{r}
#ggplot(pre_surveys, aes(x = `What.is.your.age.`, fill = `What.is.your.gender....Selected.Choice`)) +
#  geom_bar() + xlab("Age") + facet_grid(~Workshop) +
#  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1))

```
